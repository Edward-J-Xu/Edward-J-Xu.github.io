# (1) Describe your value proposition and project goal

- Describe the general market segment you are targeting, potential contributions you see as important for the area, what potential value you are bringing to the area, what problems / empty niches you originally identified and how your project addressed them.
- Describe what specific problems you focused on for your project.

# (2) Product anticipated users

- Describe user groups you have identified for your product and include personas / empathy maps you have created.

# (3) User Interviews

- Describe your interviewees in general terms (number, average age, gender distribution, other demographic information important for your study).
- Describe the methods you used to conduct and analyze the user interviews (e.g., interview questions, affinity diagramming, work models).
- Report on interview results: describe and discuss identified themes and detailed results, problems (breakdowns) you identified and decided to focus on.

# (4) Initial design ideas

- Discuss how you came up with the initial set of features (e.g., user stories, storyboarding), and what specific information from the user interviews you used in your initial design.
- Include sketches, user flows, and images of your paper prototypes.

# (5) Paper prototypes and evaluation

- Describe the goals and hypotheses you have formulated for your paper prototype evaluation study.
- Describe the set of tasks you gave to your participants.
- Report on paper prototype evaluation results: describe and discuss identified themes and detailed results, your analysis of possible reasons for identified problems in design.

# (6) Design Iteration

- Describe design changes you have identified as required based on paper prototype evaluation results, provide corresponding reasoning. Include screenshots of your evolving design.

# (7) High fidelity prototypes and evaluation

- Describe goals you have formulated for your high fidelity prototype evaluation study.
- Describe the results of heuristic evaluation: which heuristics were used and why, which tasks you gave to your participants, report on results.
- Describe the results of cognitive walkthrough: which tasks you gave to the participants, report on results.
- Report on design changes that are required to improve the prototype based on the hi-fi evaluation.

# (8) Conclusion

- Reflect on the design process you went through and include your final thoughts on the project (e.g., do you think your app has sufficiently addressed the problems you set out to solve at the beginning of the term? What would you do differently if you could redo this project again?)
